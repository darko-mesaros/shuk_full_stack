# Shuk full stack project

**PLEASE NOTE:** This is still a work in progress. Deploy at your own risk.

The goal of this project is to provide individuals a full stack deployment of additional features and services for the [shuk](https://github.com/darko-mesaros/shuk) file uploader utility. It is meant to be deployed on your own AWS account.

Current Plans:
- Provide backing up of files to other S3 buckets (just in case)
- Converting QuickTime `.mov` videos into `.mp4`
- Storing metadata of all the files
- Providing a dashboard of all the files uploaded and managed by `shuk`
- User authentication (?)
